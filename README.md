# smartMirror
A Raspberry Pi smart mirror, with voice control

Uses "snowboy" to provide local hotword detection, before using "annyang" for command recognition

  To launch:
    ```
      nodejs smartMirror2.js
    ```
    
  Then navigate to ``` localhost:8080 ``` in Google Chrome (or a flavour of Chromium), for voice control support
